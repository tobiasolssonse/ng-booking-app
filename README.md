Application is made by me to develop and test my Angular skills.
Content and bookings are stored in a Firebase Cloud Firestore.

firebaseconfig.ts my key removed
export const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: ...,
    authDomain: 'ng-booking-app-9b2a1.firebaseapp.com',
    databaseURL: 'https://ng-booking-app-9b2a1.firebaseio.com',
    projectId: ...,
    storageBucket: ...,
    messagingSenderId: ...,
    appId: ...
}; 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.
